          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
          GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. ASA will put the games on Demosphere. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with Demosphere, let me know. Many times I receive communication from ASA at the same time as you do, so beware of that and am a busy person like most of you. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In rare cases, I might default some communication back to Demosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. I think we are all (including myself) too quick to judge about many things. Please, please, please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but I will do my best. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Emotions can run high during a season, so I ask that we all keep our emotions in check. Being disruptive or passive aggressive will not help the situation. Yelling at me or talking to me angrily obviously is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. 
          </p>

          <h3>Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          The team will have team fees of $5 to help cover costs incurred by the team for various things (soccer goals, soccer equipment, coaching equipment, etc.). I will send out friendly reminders if I don't recieve them.

          </p>
          <p>
          To ensure the team has the best possible environment to learn and compete, we collect a small team fee to cover essential operating costs. While I volunteer my time to coach and organize, these fees ensure the "behind the scenes" of the season run smoothly. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Where do the fees go? 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Equipment Maintenance: Constant use means balls, cones, goals, rebounding board, tent, wagon, lights, and training equipment need regular replacement to keep practices effective.</li>
            <li>Facility Rentals: To give the boys extra development time, we occasionally rent indoor or specialized field space.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          My goal is to keep the focus on coaching and player development. By streamlining these costs upfront, I can dedicate my energy to the kids on the field and ensure a high-quality experience for every player. 
          </p>

          <h3>Uniforms</h3>
          <p>
          Those that were with us last season, we will use the same custom shirts.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Those that are new, we will order a custom jersey with a number and a name (usually last name) on the back.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If you are new and need a jersey, please fill out the form and follow the payment instructions. (<a href=https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160>https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160</a>)
          <br>
          If received late, I can't promise your jersey will arrive on time for the first game.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Each child will also need black shorts for games. Shorts will be bought separately by the parents.  
          </p>

          <h3>Practices</h3>
          <p>
          Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can try to make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Practices are optional, but I want each kid to be improving and understanding where I want them to be on the field, so they are highly encouraged. I understand we all have busy lives and may not be able to attend all the time. I'd like to have as many as possible especially before our first game, but I'm generally worried about it being too cold (below 50 deg F) or hot (over 100 deg F).  
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are links to the ASA website about fields and a picture of the fields at Celebration Park.

          </p>
          <p>
          The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
          </p>
 

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
          The boys will need to wear shin guards and socks for practices and games. From ASA guidelines: "Shin guards must be worn under the socks, with the socks completely covering the shin guards." I highly suggest soccer socks, but I do not recommend the umbro socks at Walmart that my son might sometimes be wearing.  
          </p>
          <p>
          As far as shoes, ASA has said: "Soccer cleats are optional." The cleats need to be soccer cleats and not football or baseball cleats.  
          </p>
          <p>
          "Proper soccer shoes must be worn. No toe cleats are allowed. No metal cleats are allowed." 
          </p>
          <p>
          Ensure that the boys' shoes are double or triple knotted.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Soccer balls - Each boy should have their own size 3 ball for practice and before games. Showing up to practice with a size 1 or size 5 will not be the most helpful in preparing your child for games.
          </p>
          <p>
          The referees will be checking these things and more at the beginning of games.  
          </p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
          Games will have referees and at half time, we will be swapping sides. Scores are not recorded with ASA, but I will usually keep score to see how competitive we are. I try to make sure all the kids get adequate game time.  
          </p>
          <p>
          I will not be able to be physically on the field. Therefore, I will need like 3 feet from the sideline to be free, so that I can run the sideline. I will have the portable sports bench during the games that I would like the boys to be sitting at in the case that I need to make a quick substitution. If they are not there, I might make the assumption that they aren't ready to go back in. If there is an issue with shoes, etc., I will not put them in the game or if they are in the game, I will substitute them out from the game before resolving the issue and possibly quickly getting them back in the game.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If someone wants to do a sign-up sheet (i.e. signup genius web page) for after game snacks, you are welcome to take the initiative and post it to the chat.  
          </p>

          <h3>Pictures</h3>
          <p>
          To simplify our lives, I've decided not to sign the team up for pictures unless there is an overwhelming want to do the pictures. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After the last game of the season/postseason, we will take a team picture. Please remind me. Also, throughout the season, please share any good pictures you take with others and/or the team.
          </p>
