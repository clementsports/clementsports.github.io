	  <h3>Communication</h3>
	  <p>
	  GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. ASA will put the games on Demosphere. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with Demosphere, let me know.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but will do my best. 
	  </p>

	  <h3>Team Fees</h3>
	  <p>
	  Due to costs incurred by the team for various things, I'm having team fees. Please send me $5. If I need more money, I will ask for more midseason.  
	  <br>
	  Paypal and Zelle  jeffclement@gmail.com 
	  <br>
	  Venmo  <a href=https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68>https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68</a>
	  </p>

	  <h3>Uniforms</h3>
	  <p>
	  Those that were with us last season, we will use the same custom shirts.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Those that are new, we will order a custom jersey with a number and a name (usually last name) on the back.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If you are new and need a jersey, please fill out the form and follow the payment instructions. (<a href=https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160>https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160</a>)
	  <br>
	  If received late, I can't promise your jersey will arrive on time for the first game.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Each child will also need black shorts for games. Shorts will be bought separately by the parents.  
	  </p>

	  <h3>Practices</h3>
	  <p>
	  Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Practices are optional, but I want each kid to be improving and understanding where I want them to be on the field, so they are highly encouraged. I understand we all have busy lives and may not be able to attend all the time. I'd like to have as many as possible especially before our first game, but I'm generally worried about it being too cold (~50 deg F) or hot.

	  </p>
	  <p>
The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
	  </p>
 

	  <h3>Equipment</h3>
	  <p>
	  The boys will need to wear shin guards and socks for practices and games. From ASA guidelines: "Shin guards must be worn under the socks, with the socks completely covering the shin guards." I highly suggest soccer socks, but I do not recommend the umbro socks at Walmart that my son might sometimes be wearing.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  As far as shoes, ASA has said: "Soccer cleats are optional." The cleats need to be soccer cleats and not football or baseball cleats.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  "Proper soccer shoes must be worn. No toe cleats are allowed. No metal cleats are allowed." 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Ensure that the boys' shoes are double or triple knotted.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Soccer balls - Each boy should have their own size 3 ball for practice and before games.   
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The referees will be checking these things and more at the beginning of games.  
	  </p>

	  <h3>Games</h3>
	  <p>
	  7U will have referees and at half time, we will be swapping sides. Scores are not recorded with ASA, but I will usually keep score to see how competitive we are. I try to make sure all the kids get adequate game time.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I will not be able to be physically on the field. Therefore, I will need like 3 feet from the sideline to be free, so that I can run the sideline. I will have the portable sports bench during the games that I would like the boys to be sitting at in the case that I need to make a quick substitution. If they are not there, I might make the assumption that they aren't ready to go back in. If there is an issue with shoes, etc., I will not put them in the game or if they are in the game, I will substitute them out from the game before resolving the issue and possibly quickly getting them back in the game.
