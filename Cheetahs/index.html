          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
          GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. ASA will put the games on Demosphere. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with Demosphere, let me know. Many times I receive communication from ASA at the same time as you do, so beware of that and am a busy person like most of you. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In rare cases, I might default some communication back to Demosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. I think we are all (including myself) too quick to judge about many things. Please, please, please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but I will do my best. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Emotions can run high during a season, so I ask that we all keep our emotions in check. Being disruptive or passive aggressive will not help the situation. Yelling at me or talking to me angrily obviously is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. 
          </p>

          <h3>Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          No team fees this season.
          <!--Due to costs incurred by the team for various things, I'm having team fees. Please send me $10. If I need more money, I will ask for more midseason.

          </p>

          <h3>Uniforms</h3>
          <p>
          Those that were with us in a previous season, we will use the same custom shirts.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Those that are new, we will order a custom jersey with a number and a name (usually last name) on the back.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If you are new and need a jersey, please fill out the form and follow the payment instructions. (<a href=https://form.jotform.com/243331338582153 >https://form.jotform.com/243331338582153</a>)
          <br>
          If received late, I can't promise your jersey will arrive on time for the first game.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Each child will also need black shorts for games. Shorts will be bought separately by the parents.  
          </p>

          <h3>ASA Practices </h3>
          <p>
          My intention is to schedule on Thursdays (preferable) or Tuesdays, but I don't get to make the final decision on court allocation. 
          </p>
          <p>
          If anyone has access to indoor 8 foot basketball court for the team, let me know. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Practices will most likely be held at Stephen G. Terrell Recreation Center (<a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/aKwvsrPb385cGDCZ7>https://maps.app.goo.gl/aKwvsrPb385cGDCZ7</a> 1680 W Exchange Pkwy, Allen, TX 75013). They can also be held at Allen ISD schools.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are links to the ASA website about courts/fields.  
          <a href=https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms>https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can try to make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team.  
          </p>
          <p>
          The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
          The boys will need to have basketball shoes for practices and games so that they can get the best traction on the court.  
          </p>
          <p>
          From ASA guidelines: "All players must wear gym appropriate shoes for basketball." 
          </p>
          <p>
          Basketballs - each boy should have their own 27.5" size ball for practice and before games.   
          </p>
          <p>
          Boys will need lots of water. Ensure that they have an adequate water bottle for practices and games. Since they will be running around a lot, I don't want them to run out. 
          </p>
          <p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
          Please be early to the games for warm up. I normally arrive a quarter an hour before a game as I like the boys to be prepared before a game. Scores will be kept. The rules are different for each age group and updated periodically.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>I need to know if your son is not going to make it to a game by updating RSVP on GameChanger. </b> I have to plan for the game ahead of time and I also am busy preparing the boys for the game. 
          </p>
          <p>
          If someone wants to do a sign-up sheet (i.e. signup genius web page) for after game snacks, you are welcome to take the initiative and post it to the chat.  
          </p>

          <h3>Pictures</h3>
          <p>
          To simplify our lives, I've decided not to sign the team up for pictures unless there is an overwhelming want to do the pictures. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After the last game of the season/postseason, we will take a team picture. Please remind me. Also, throughout the season, please share any good pictures you take with others and/or the team.
          </p>
