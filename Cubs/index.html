          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p>
          ASA prioritizes the safety of the boys and I truly do as well. I want to follow the rules as much as possible to keep the boys safe and have a good time. If you see something dangerous like the boys swinging their bats at each other, please step in and make the adjustment.
          </p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
          GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. ASA will put the games on Demosphere. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with Demosphere, let me know. Many times I receive communication from ASA at the same time as you do, so beware of that and am a busy person like most of you. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In rare cases, I might default some communication back to Demosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. I think we are all (including myself) too quick to judge about many things. Please, please, please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but I will do my best. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Emotions can run high during a season, so I ask that we all keep our emotions in check. Being disruptive or passive aggressive will not help the situation. Yelling at me or talking to me angrily obviously is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. 
          </p>

          <h3>Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          The team will have <b>team fees of $50</b> to help cover practice field, equipment costs, indoor practices, etc. You can pay however is easiest for you (check, cash, Venmo, Paypal, Zelle). If it makes you feel better to do it in person, we can do it before practice or after practice. Please do it in a timely manner by the first practice though. Indoor practices costs the team and it isn't fair to the team if one isn't paying the team fees. 
          <br>
          Zelle (preferred) jeffclement@gmail.com 224-715-0893
          <br>
          Paypal jeffclement@gmail.com
          <br>
          Venmo  <a href=https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68>https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Uniforms</h3>
          <p>
          The plan is for everyone to have a jersey, hat, pants, socks, and belt for everyone. I would like all of the kids to be close to matching. If you need a uniform, order it (at least the jersey and hat) by <b>Saturday, August 16, 2025 or whenever the store closes</b>.
          <br>
          <a href=https://cubsclementbaseball.itemorder.com/>https://cubsclementbaseball.itemorder.com/</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          The reason the uniform store closes so early (3 weeks before the original scheduled 1st game) before the season is to take advantage of the store's guarantee that the uniforms will be ready for our first game. Usually, the uniforms will not be ready until the week before the 1st game, so depending upon the schedule, you may or may not have your full uniform before the day of the 1st game. Sometimes, part of the uniform comes just before the 1st game. That is one of reasons it's extra important to be early to the 1st game. 
          </p>
          <p>
          The pants will be gray. The socks and belt will be either royal blue or black.
          </p>

          <h3>Practices</h3>
          <p>
          Development of the kids' skills is so important. I want each kid to be improving and understanding where I want them to be on the field. The kids need to be prepared for success and so that they have a less likelihood of getting hurt. 
          </p>
          <p>
          ASA has stated: "Parents are expected to support the coaches by having their player to practices on time and encouraging full participation at all times so that the players learn the game situations and what they are supposed to do to prevent injury to themselves or other players due to the inherent dangers of the sport."
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Be on time to practice.</b> Be prepared with all equipment and gear. Practice is my slice of time to make your kids better. It makes it harder on me when kids and coaches come late and practices become disorganized. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>My plan is try to have practices on only these days (not every one though): Tues., Thurs., and/or Sat.</b> Also, be aware of the practice location as it might change. We are fighting for space at the baseball parks (Allen, Plano, McKinney, etc.) and public parks. Public parks that we might go to for non-field practices: Quail Run Park, Watters Crossing Park, Tejas Park, Green Elementary Park, Boon Elementary Park, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
          Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I will add practices as I can. ASA unfortunately doesn't assigned baseball field practice day/times until very soon to the time they start. You can check the "Important Dates" to see what week practice field practices are supposedly going to start. ASA does not tell me the day that we have a baseball field until the last minute. I usually find out at the same time you do. For some teams in the Fall 2024 season, some teams had about a day's notice. I also assume that our assigned baseball field practice time will at 5:30pm, but that will change with the age of the kids. Please wear baseball pants and protective cups especially to baseball field practices.
          </p>
          <p>
          Parent meeting will be at the beginning of the first practice. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are links to the ASA website about baseball fields.  
          <br>
          <a href=https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms>https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
          The boys will need a protective cup, glove, helmet, baseball cap (will get one as part of uniform), bat, water bottle, and cleats (soccer, baseball, football, even turf will be okay, although I strongly recommend baseball/football ones).  
          </p>
          <p>
          The ASA rules state: 
          <br>
          "Metal cleats are NOT allowed." 
          <br>
          "All players must wear a protective cup for the groin." 
          </p>
          <p>
          Bats - "Youth League standard of 2-1/4" to 2-3/4" diameter but no greater than drop 12 (-12) and no longer than 32 inches in length." The umpire ensures that it will "conform to USSSA and or USA Baseball standards." 
          <br>
          "NO SOFTBALL BATS WILL BE ALLOWED IN ANY LEAGUE OR DIVISION" 
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment Tips</h3>
          <h4>Bat</h4>
          <p>
          "USSSA baseball bats designed for kid pitch play provide the highest threshold of performance as well as the largest barrel diameters in the game. As a result, when permitted, we suggest that you swing one of these models." (<a href=https://www.justbats.com/buying-guides/baseball-bats/>https://www.justbats.com/buying-guides/baseball-bats/</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          It will depend upon the height, age, and strength of your kid what your kid should use. 
          </p>
          <p>
          As of Spring 2025, my son who is on the smaller size is using a 25" bat with drop of -11 with 2-5/8" diameter barrel. (<a href=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Easton-MAXUM-Youth-Tball-Bat-25-inch-11/755195717>https://www.walmart.com/ip/Easton-MAXUM-Youth-Tball-Bat-25-inch-11/755195717</a>). My son will be using a larger bat this upcoming Fall. In general, you want to have a longer bat and larger barrel if your son can handle it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are some bat guides to get a better perspective: (<a href=https://www.rawlings.com/sizing-bats.html>https://www.rawlings.com/sizing-bats.html</a>, <a href=https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/rc/baseball-bat-buying-guide>https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/rc/baseball-bat-buying-guide</a>). As of early 2025 for my son, one table says to use 24-26" and the other says to use 27", so their ability to swing the correct size bat is the most important indication. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are some ideas for <a href=https://www.justbats.com/products/length~27%20inch/>27" bats</a>.  
          </p>
          <p>
          At this age, wooden bats are just for training. 
          </p>
          <p>
          If you find a used high quality bat at a good price, it might be worth it.
          </p>
          <h4>Glove</h4>
          <p>
          For reference, my son uses a 10.5" baseball glove. I know other kids use smaller gloves (9" or 9.5"); some use larger gloves. Most important is that they feel comfortable catching with it.  
          </p>
          <p>
          I would recommend reading this guide. <a href=https://www.justballgloves.com/buying-guide/>https://www.justballgloves.com/buying-guide/</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
          Warm up will start 45 minutes before a game. If your boy wants to do extra warm up or has special things he want to do before the game, it is best to do it before the team warmup before the game, so the team can warm up together. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Scores will be kept. The rules are different for each age group and updated periodically.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>I need to know if your son is not going to make it to a game. Please let me know sooner rather than later by updating RSVP on GameChanger. </b> I have to plan for the game ahead of time and I also am busy preparing the boys for the game. If you are going to miss part of the game for any reason, please let me know too as that might mean (to the umpire) in certain circumstances that we would forfeit or receive penalty.
          </p>
          <p>
          Every kid might be playing catcher at some point. Currently, the catcher equipment is provided by ASA.
          </p>
          <p>
          Every kid most likely will be playing the outfield at some point.
          </p>
          <p>
          The boys need to prove to me in practice that they can play a position to play it. The kids will probably not be playing the same exact field position throughout a game. As this is a recreational league, it's for their own development and I don't think it's appropriate. 
          </p>
          <p>
          There are a lot of rules in baseball and most are at the discretion of the umpire. If you see something off with the game, opponent, etc. and it's time sensitive, talk to me immediately during the game.
          </p>
          <p>
          I will need parents to help with scorekeeping and helping the kids with the catcher's gear.
          </p>
          <p>
          For Spring season, the 1st game is around the beginning of March. For Fall season, the 1st game is around the beginning of September.

          </p>
          <h3>Scorekeeping</h3>
          <p>
          I have a scorekeeping book to record how both teams perform. One of the most important things to do is to ensure the other team follows their batting order. If we are the away team, ensure that the other team scores correctly on the scoreboard. If there is ever an issue or discrepancy, please come talk to me IMMEDIATELY!!
          </p>
          <p>
          I understand that doing the scorekeeping is quite demanding and am grateful for the people helping out the team. I especially want to know the final score, score for each inning, and the number of bases each batter gains. <b>The scorekeeping book is what determines the official score</b>; the scoreboard does not. The scorekeeping book allows me to look back at the game and almost see what happened play by play. It would be great to see the inning score, the outs numbered in an inning, differentiate strikeouts from other outs, number of bases each hitter gains (e.g. 1 base, 1 base and overthrow, 2 bases, in-field home run, etc.). These things help me evaluate how the kids are doing.
          </p>
          <p>
          During home games, we need to do the scoreboard. I prefer it to be the same person as the scorekeeping book so that they are in sync, but I will leave that up to the person doing the scorekeeping book.
          </p>
          <p>
          The scoreboard app is DAK Score by Daktronics. If another person connects to it, the scorekeeper can not connect to it. An ASA 8U regulation game is 80 minutes. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Some references to help you scorekeep.

          </p>
          <h3>Post season</h3>
          <p>
          There is a post season. Limited information is on the ASA baseball webpage. Communication about details usually comes out pretty late. I wish they would communicate earlier about it, but there is a lot of coordination they have to do, so it all ends up being last minute.
          </p>
          <h3>Team Formation</h3>
          <p>
          ASA states: "Recreational players may play up a maximum of 1 year (following the age eligibility chart on ASA’s website."
          </p>
          <p>
          In general, I wouldn't recommend playing up due to the level of game play and the expectations of the coaches.
          </p>
          <p>
          I don't recommend playing in another baseball league at the same time (or overlapping) due to conflicts. The team needs everyone to attend as many games as possible. 
          </p>

          <h3>Coaching Staff</h3>
          <p>
          Assistant Coaches are a helpful addition for games (as it's best to have a coach catcher, 1st base coach, 3rd base coach, etc.). It is a privilege to help coach. Guidance regarding communication (as stated in the Communication section) also applies to the assistant coaches. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I may not need much help of assistant coaches during practice. I think it might be best if I just ask for help when I need it during each individual practice.
          </p>
          <p>
          I would like helpful assistant coaches and ones that I can trust. The attention span is small for some kids and assistant coaches can definitely help with that. I don't need assistant coaches that are causing distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
          All official coaches at the game are expected to shake hands with the opposing team. At the same time, I don't expect you to say anything unless it's respectful.
          </p>

          <h3>Weather and Reschedules</h3>
          <p>
          The city of Allen makes the determination whether we use their baseball fields on the Rainout line (<a href=https://rainoutline.com/search/dnis/4692144255>https://rainoutline.com/search/dnis/4692144255</a>). On Saturday and Sunday, they make the determination around 7am the day of. On weekdays, they make the determination around 3pm. This makes the determination later than sometimes we want but also close to game time. 
          </p>
          <p>
          ASA might reschedule our field to a turf field at the last minute. For example, this might mean I think the game is cancelled due to the city of Allen at 3pm and then it is not cancelled due to the reschedule at 3:30pm. This is rare, but it has happened and want you to be aware of it.
          </p>
          <p>
          You can ask me in the chat before the city makes their determination, but I will say I have to wait to hear what the official determination by the City of Allen or ASA is. I understand that it is unnerving to be held in limbo, but this is their process.
          </p>
          <p>
          I make the determination on days where we practice at public parks. I usually follow what the city of Allen dictates. I have been known to change an outside practice to an inside practice at an indoor facilty. Usually this type of reschedule is done the day before after reviewing the weather forecast. Therefore, the time of practice will probabaly change too due to availability of the indoor facility. If we have an ASA scheduled Allen baseball field practice, I usually don't reschedule them to an indoor facility due to the scheduling complexity.
          </p>

          <h3>Pictures</h3>
          <p>
          To simplify our lives, I've decided not to sign the team up for individual/team pictures unless there is an overwhelming want to do the pictures. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After the last game of the season/postseason, we will take a team picture. Please remind me. Also, throughout the season, please share any good pictures/videos you take with others and/or the team.
          </p>
