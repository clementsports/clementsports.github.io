          <h3>Safety</h3>
          <p>
          ASA prioritizes the safety of the boys and I do as well. I want to follow the rules as much as possible to keep the boys safe and have a good time. If you see something dangerous like the boys swinging their bats at each other, please step in and make the adjustment.
          </p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
          GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. ASA will put the games on Demosphere. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with Demosphere, let me know.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. Please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but will do my best. 
          </p>

          <h3>Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          The team will have <b>team fees of $50</b> to help cover practice field, equipment costs, etc. You can pay however is easiest for you (check, cash, Venmo, Paypal, Zelle). If it makes you feel better to do it in person, we can do it before practice or after practice. Please do it in a timely manner by the first practice though.
          <br>
          Paypal and Zelle (preferred) jeffclement@gmail.com
          <br>
          Venmo  <a href=https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68>https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Uniforms</h3>
          <p>
          The plan is for everyone to have a jersey, hat, pants, socks, and belt for everyone. I would like all of the kids to be close to matching. If you need a uniform, order it (at least the jersey and hat) by <b>Saturday, February 8, 2025 or whenever the store closes</b>.
          <br>
          <a href=https://cubsclementbaseball.itemorder.com/>https://cubsclementbaseball.itemorder.com/</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          The pants will be gray. The socks and belt will be either royal blue or black.
          </p>

          <h3>Practices</h3>
          <p>
          Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I want each kid to be improving and understanding where I want them to be on the field. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Be on time to practice.</b> Be prepared with all equipment and gear. Practice is my slice of time to make your kids better. It makes it harder on me when kids and coaches come late and practices become disorganized. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>My plan is try to have practices on only these days (not every one though): Tues., Thurs., and/or Sat.</b> Also, be aware of the practice location as it might change. We are fighting for space at the parks. Public parks that we might go to for non-field practices: Watters Crossing Park, Tejas Park, Quail Run Park, Green Elementary Park, Boon Elementary Park, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
          I will add practices as I can. ASA hasn't assigned baseball field practice day/times yet. ASA does not tell me the day that we have a baseball field until the last minute. For some teams in the Fall 2024 season, some teams had about a day's notice. I also assume that our assigned baseball field practice time will at 5:30pm, but that will change with the age of the kids. Please wear baseball pants and protective cups to baseball field practices.
          </p>
          <p>
          Parent meeting will be at the beginning of the first practice. 
          </p>
          <p>
          For Spring season, the 1st game is around the beginning of March. For Fall season, the 1st game is around the beginning of September.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are links to the ASA website about baseball fields.  
          <br>
          <a href=https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms>https://www.allensports.org/fields-gyms</a>
          </p>
          <p>
          The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
          The boys will need a protective cup, glove, helmet, baseball cap (will get one as part of uniform), bat, water bottle, and cleats (soccer, baseball, football, even turf will be okay, although I strongly recommend baseball/football ones).  
          </p>
          <p>
          The ASA rules state: 
          <br>
          "Metal cleats are NOT allowed." 
          <br>
          "All players must wear a protective cup for the groin." 
          </p>
          <p>
          Bats - "Youth League standard of 2-1/4" to 2-3/4" diameter but no greater than drop 12 (-12) and no longer than 32 inches in length" 
          <br>
          "NO SOFTBALL BATS WILL BE ALLOWED IN ANY LEAGUE OR DIVISION" 
          </p>

          <h3>Equipment Tips</h3>
          <h4>Bat</h4>
          <p>
          It will depend upon the age and strength of your kid, ... As a possible starter bat, I would recommend a 24" bat with a -12 drop. One of the bat's we have is <a href=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rawlings-RX4-USA-Youth-Tball-Bat-12-24-inch/660468610>https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rawlings-RX4-USA-Youth-Tball-Bat-12-24-inch/660468610</a>. Although it may not seem much of a difference with a larger bat, it has affected the performance of my son in the past. Hitting will be very important this season as there will be outs. 
          </p>
          Another bat that I have is this or very similar: <a href=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Easton-MAXUM-Youth-Tball-Bat-25-inch-11/755195717>https://www.walmart.com/ip/Easton-MAXUM-Youth-Tball-Bat-25-inch-11/755195717</a>. Here are some bat guides to get a better perspective: (<a href=https://www.rawlings.com/sizing-bats.html>https://www.rawlings.com/sizing-bats.html</a>, <a href=https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/rc/baseball-bat-buying-guide>https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/rc/baseball-bat-buying-guide</a>).
          <p>
          </p>
          <h4>Glove</h4>
          <p>
          For reference, my son uses a 10" baseball glove. I know other kids use smaller gloves (9" or 9.5"). Most important is that they feel comfortable catching with it.  
          </p>
          <h4>Misc</h4>
          <p>
          I've bought stuff at Walmart, Play It Again Sports, Dick's Sports, Academy Sports, etc. ASA (and PSA) sometimes has coupons at Dick's. You don't have to break the bank to get good enough quality equipment for these kids. 
          </p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
          Please be early to the games for warm up. I normally arrive a half an hour before a game as I have routine of things I like the boys to do before a game. Scores will be kept. The rules are different for each age group and updated periodically.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>I need to know if your son is not going to make it to a game by updating RSVP on GameChanger. </b> I have to plan for the game ahead of time and I also am busy preparing the boys for the game. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Every kid will be playing catcher. The boys need to prove to me in practice that they can play a position to play it. 
          </p>
          <p>
          There are a lot of rules in baseball and most are at the discretion of the umpire. If you see something off with the game, opponent, etc., talk to me immediately during the game if it's time sensitive.
          </p>
          <h3>Pictures</h3>
          <p>
          To simplify our lives, I've decided not to sign the team up for pictures unless there is an overwhelming want to do the pictures. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After the last game of the season/postseason, we will take a team picture. Please remind me. Also, throughout the season, please share any good pictures you take with others and/or the team.
          </p>
