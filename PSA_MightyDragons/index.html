          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>
          GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. PSA will put the games on DaySmart. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with DaySmart, let me know.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. I think we are all (including myself) too quick to judge about many things. Please, please, please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but I will do my best. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Emotions can run high during a season, so I ask that we all keep our emotions in check. Being disruptive or passive aggressive will not help the situation. Yelling at me or talking to me angrily obviously is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. 
          </p>

          <h3>Summer Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          There will be a Mighty Dragons team fee of $15 for the session.
          If we want to have more practices during the season at a non-PSA indoor facility, the team might have to collect more money. 
          If it makes you feel better to do it in person, we can do it before practice or after practice. Please do it in a timely manner by the first practice though.

          <h3>Winter 1 & 2 Team Fees</h3>
          <p>
          There will be a Mighty Dragons team fee of $15 for each session.
          If we want to have more practices during the season at a non-PSA indoor facility, the team might have to collect more money. 
          If it makes you feel better to do it in person, we can do it before practice or after practice. Please do it in a timely manner by the first practice though.

          <h3>Uniforms</h3>
          <p>
          Those that were with us in a previous season, we will use the same custom shirts.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Those that are new, we will order a custom jersey with a number and a name (usually last name) on the back.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If you are new and need a jersey, please fill out the form and follow the payment instructions. (<a href=https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160>https://form.jotform.com/243330904789160</a>)
          <br>
          If received late, I can't promise your jersey will arrive on time for the first game.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Each child will also need black shorts for games. Shorts will be bought separately by the parents.  
          </p>

          <h3>Practices</h3>
          <p>
          In case I forget, sometimes it's helpful for me to know the major intersections where you live, so communicate that to me at some point. This helps me to ensure practice location isn't too burdensome for people.
          </p>
          <p>
          Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can try to make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Practices are optional, but I want each kid to be improving and understanding where I want them to be on the field, so they are highly encouraged. I understand we all have busy lives and may not be able to attend all the time. I'd like to have as many as possible especially before our first game, but I'm generally worried about it being too cold (~50 deg F) for Winter seasons.  
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>My plan is try to have practices on only these days (not every one though): Monday(main practice day), Wednesday, and/or Sat.</b> Also, be aware of the practice location as it might change.
          </p>
          <p>
          I plan on having a number of indoor practices at PSA 1 when available. PSA only allows me to schedule one week out.
          </p>
          <p>
          Other times, we are fighting for space at the parks. Public parks that we might go to for non-field practices: Tejas Park, Russell Creek Park, Watters Crossing Park, Green Park, etc. In Summer times, I will prefer locations where we can be in the shade.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here are links to the PSA website. 
          <br>
          <a href=https://www.psaplano.org/Home/Sports/Soccer.aspx>PSA Soccer</a>
          <br>
          </p>
          <p>
          The practice schedule will be on the GameChanger app.  
          </p>


          <h3>Equipment</h3>
          <p>
          The boys will need to wear shin guards and socks for practices and games.  
          </p>
          <p>
          I am recommending the kids to have turf cleats though not absolutely necessary.  
          </p>
          <p>
          From PSA guidelines: "The equipment worn by a player during the entire game shall consist of: ...Shin guards - Completely covered by the appropriate size socks. Indoor soccer footwear â€“ No outdoor soccer cleats, baseball shoes or football shoes are allowed. NO TOE CLEATS ARE ALLOWED ON THE TURF."  
          </p>
          <p>
          "Players must wear shoes. A player's footwear must conform to the following standards: Flat Soled shoes or other footwear designed for an artificial surface must be worn. No footwear with fewer than 30 molded mini-studs shall be permitted." 
          </p>
          <p>
          Ensure that the boys' shoes are double or triple knotted.  
          </p>
          <p>
          Soccer balls - Each boy should have their own size 3 ball for practice and before games.   
          </p>
          <p>
          I assume that the referees will be checking these things and more at the beginning of games.  
          </p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
          At half time, we will be swapping sides. Scores are recorded with PSA. I try to make sure all the kids get adequate game time.  
          </p>
          <p>
          If there is an issue with shoes, etc., I will not put them in the game or if they are in the game, I will substitute them out from the game before resolving the issue and possibly quickly getting them back in the game.  
          </p>
