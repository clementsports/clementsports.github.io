	  <h3>Communication</h3>
	  <p>
	  GameChanger will be how we communicate everything this season. I will be using the chat and calendar for scheduling practices, games, etc. PSA will put the games on DaySmart. If the games on GameChanger are ever out of sync with DaySmart, let me know.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If you ever have any questions or concerns about practice, games, or the team in general, please don't hesitate to pull me aside. I want this to be a great experience for all of us, so please don't be frustrated by anything in silence. Please, please, please communicate with me in a mature way and I will do my best. Yelling at me or talking to me angrily obviously is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. Being disruptive or passive aggressive will not help the situation. I can't promise I will be able to fix it or change anything, but will do my best. 
	  </p>

	  <h3>Team Fees</h3>
	  <p>
    In order to schedule some extra practices and costs incurred by the team for various things, I'm having team fees of $20.
    </p>
	  <p>
    If I need more money, I will ask for more midseason.
    </p>
	  <p>
	  Paypal and Zelle (preferred) jeffclement@gmail.com 
	  <br>
	  Venmo  <a href=https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68>https://www.venmo.com/u/jsc68</a>
	  </p>

	  <h3>Uniforms</h3>
	  <p>
	  Those that were with us in a previous season, we will use the same custom shirts.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Those that are new, we will order a custom jersey with a number and a name (usually last name) on the back.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If you are new and need a jersey, please fill out the form and follow the payment instructions. (<a href=https://form.jotform.com/243331338582153 >https://form.jotform.com/243331338582153</a>)
	  <br>
	  If received late, I can't promise your jersey will arrive on time for the first game.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Each child will also need black shorts for games. Shorts will be bought separately by the parents.  
	  </p>

    <h3> PSA Facilities </h3>
    <p>
    PSA has 4 faclities: PSA 1, PSA 2, PSA McKinney, and PSA Murphy. For address info and more, see <a href=https://www.psaplano.org/Home/Directions.aspx>https://www.psaplano.org/Home/Directions.aspx</a>
    </p>

    <h3> PSA Practices </h3>
    <p>
    We are registered with McKinney, so I will try to schedule there although I might have to schedule at a different location due to availability.
	  </p>
	  <p>
    PSA has allocated us 3 "free" practices. PSA has said: "Teams must be paid 100% to receive their 3 practices. Summer practice may not be scheduled prior to May 27th."
	  </p>
	  <p>
    Since I'd like to practice more, we will have more practices (paid via team fees). At a PSA facility, we have to rent a full court unless I can share it with another team somehow. PSA has stated: "Once season begins, practices can only be booked on weekends at PSA 1 location or upon availability." Therefore, my plan is to have practices on Saturdays when I can schedule them. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Let me know when you have conflicts before I start scheduling practice, so I can try to make it a good time for all. I am much less forgiving after I schedule things because you want me to prioritize you over someone else on the team.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
    The practice schedule is on the GameChanger app.  
	  </p>

	  <h3>Equipment</h3>
	  <p>
    The boys will need to have basketball shoes for practices and games so that they can get the best traction on the court.  
    </p>
	  <p>
    From ASA guidelines: "All players must wear gym appropriate shoes for basketball." 
    </p>
	  <p>
    Basketballs - each boy should have their own 27.5" size ball for practice and before games.   
    </p>
	  <p>
    Boys will need lots of water. Ensure that they have an adequate water bottle for practices and games. Since they will be running around a lot, I don't want them to run out. 
    </p>
	  <p>

	  <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>
    Please be early to the games for warm up. I normally arrive a quarter an hour before a game as I like the boys to be prepared before a game. Scores will be kept. The rules are different for each age group and updated periodically.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>I need to know if your son is not going to make it to a game by updating RSVP on GameChanger. </b> I have to plan for the game ahead of time and I also am busy preparing the boys for the game.
